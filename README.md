## Exploring Wildfires: Can Only *We* Prevent Forest Fires?
**Authors:** Gopalika Sharma and Surya Menon 

#### Summary:
One of the growing threats to our existence is the increasing number of forest fires. Due to the impacts of climate change resulting in higher temperatures and drier conditions, we are observing lengthening forest fire seasons, particularly in the western United States (Figures 1 and 2).<sup>1</sup> Forest fires can be beneficial for the environment, by clearing the forest floor of heavy brush and signaling some tree species to release their seeds, but when these fires become larger and harder to manage, we observe increasingly catastrophic and devastating consequences, including the destruction of property, wildlife, and human lives.<sup>2</sup>  The costly interactions between humans and wildfires demonstrate the need to understand the relationship between them, especially in the face of changing climate conditions and expanding human communities. The enormous uncertainty about the size, location, and number of the future forest fires creates an interesting analytical and predictive modeling challenge.

We have found geospatial data for historic wildfires in the United States from 1992-2015, as well as a dataset from Portugal recording instances of the forest fires and contributing environmental factors (i.e. temperature, wind, humidity, etc.).<sup>3,4</sup> With this project and analysis, we are hoping to shed some light on the behavior of these wildfires by exploring trends and patterns over time. We would like to visualize the distribution of these fires, specifically in California, alongside other factors (i.e. population, infrastructure, wildlife distribution) to assess the overall impact of these fires. Visualizing this information through a dashboard could help the state of California determine where additional resources are needed to alleviate the impact. We additionally want to explore the possibility of predicting certain aspects of these fires, such as fire size (regression) and cause (classification); the two datasets we are exploring have different types of features, and through this project we plan to determine which particular factors play pivotal roles in these predictions. Better anticipating the severity of a fire or the possible cause can be instrumental in reducing future destruction in a community by ensuring there are resources in place for safety, management, and faster containment.
